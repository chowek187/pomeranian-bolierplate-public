      <p className="blog-text">
        Pop culture used to define a generation, but it seems the cultural,
        music and fashion trends of the 1990s have been recycled, and what
        Generation X considered its rite of passage into adulthood, is being
        discovered and claimed by fledgling grown-ups as their own.

      <p2 className="blog-text">
        There's been the resurgence of vinyl as the trend-setters choice of
        music consumption rather than the ease os a digital download, and now
        the hipsters have discovered the nostalgic sound.
